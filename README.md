# Homework02-
Hi this is my submission for week 2's challenge, i apologise for the late submission ive been caught up in things outside of work and am now having to catch up on work ;( 

    Anyways i have attempted to create a portfolio according to the acceptance criteria. For styling i couldnt figure how to get my page title and nav bar into a colour filled in border so i left it blank. My UI on my nav bar is scrolling for me aswell. I couldnt figure out how to add an application on to the page a long with a link so i left that point out. I hope this was a decent attempt, 
    Thank You
